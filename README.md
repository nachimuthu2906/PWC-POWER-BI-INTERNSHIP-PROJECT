# PWC-POWER-BI-INTERNSHIP-PROJECT üåü

## Project Overview üìä
This project was completed as part of my PwC Switzerland internship (on Forage), focusing on analyzing HR data and generating insights using **Excel** and **Power BI**. The project involved performing data analysis and visualization to provide actionable business insights.

## Tasks Overview ‚úÖ
The project was divided into four tasks:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Using Excel to clean and organize raw HR data.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing key metrics such as gender ratios, promotion rates, and salary differences using Excel.
3. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**: Creating interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize insights.
4. **Presentation of Insights**: Summarizing findings and presenting key insights via Power BI visualizations.

## Technologies Used üíª
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.

## Files and Folders Structure üóÇÔ∏è
- `/Excel` - Contains Excel files used for data cleaning and analysis.
- `/PowerBI` - Includes the Power BI (.pbix) files with interactive dashboards for each task.
- `/Reports` - Any reports or documentation summarizing insights from the analysis.

## How to View the Power BI Dashboards üõ†Ô∏è
1. Download the `.pbix` file from the `/PowerBI` folder.
2. Open it using **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Explore the different dashboards to view the insights.

## TASK 1 
Introduction of internship 

## TASK 2

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides detailed insights into call center operations. The data set includes various metrics relevant to call center performance, such as response times, customer satisfaction scores, and agent performance. The objective of this analysis is to help management identify key performance areas, optimize operations, and enhance overall customer experience.

## Features
- Interactive Dashboard: Filterable and drillable visualizations for in-depth exploration of call center performance.
- Performance Metrics: Displays key metrics, such as average response time, call resolution rates, and customer satisfaction.
- Agent Analysis: Detailed insights into individual agent performance, including call handling times and resolution efficiency.
- Trend Analysis: Visualizations for monitoring trends in call volume and response times over time.

## Insights & Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following key insights were identified:
- Peak Call Volume: Call volume spikes during specific hours/days, suggesting staffing adjustments during peak times.
- Customer Satisfaction: Quicker response times correlate with higher customer satisfaction ratings.
- Agent Efficiency: Some agents consistently resolve calls faster and achieve higher satisfaction ratings, suggesting potential best practices.

## TASK 3
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data using both Excel and Power BI. The objective is to identify trends and key indicators related to customer churn to help management develop strategies for customer retention. The project leverages Excel for initial data exploration and Power BI for interactive, in-depth analysis through visualizations.

## Features
- Data Exploration in Excel: Preliminary analysis and cleaning of the churn data were performed in Excel.
- Interactive Power BI Dashboard: A comprehensive Power BI dashboard allows users to filter and drill down into churn metrics.
- Churn Indicators: Insights into customer behavior and factors leading to churn, such as service usage and customer complaints.
- Trend Analysis: Visualizations showing churn trends over time, segmented by customer categories.
   
## Insights & Recommendations
The following insights were derived from the analysis:
- High Churn Among Short-Tenure Customers: Customers with shorter tenure are likelier to churn, suggesting improved early retention strategies are needed.
- Contract Type: Customers on month-to-month contracts churn significantly more than those on long-term contracts.
- Monthly Charges: Higher charges seem to be correlated with increased churn, especially for non-contract customers.

## TASK 4
## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of interactive data visualizations in Power BI using employee data. The visualizations aim to analyze various aspects of employee performance, promotions, turnover rates, and demographic information.

## Insights & Recommendations
- Bar Charts: Display performance ratings and promotion counts.
- Pie Charts: Show distribution of genders and age groups.
- Line Graphs: Illustrate trends over time regarding promotions and turnover.
- Filters: Enable users to filter data by department, job level, and other parameters for detailed analysis.

## Conclusion
- Insights into Customer and Employee Behavior: The analyses reveal crucial insights into both customer and employee behaviors. The call center analysis highlights the importance of response times in enhancing customer satisfaction, while the churn analysis identifies factors leading to customer retention challenges. Similarly, employee data visualization uncovers trends in performance and turnover rates, emphasizing the need for effective management strategies.

- Impact of Promotions and Contracts: Both the churn and employee analyses demonstrate the significant influence of promotions and contract types on retention rates. New customers are more likely to churn, suggesting that early engagement strategies are essential, while employee analysis shows that promotions positively affect retention. These findings underscore the importance of strategic decision-making in managing both customer and employee relationships.

- Data-Driven Decision Making: The use of interactive data visualizations in Power BI across all projects facilitates a data-driven approach to decision-making. By visualizing complex data, stakeholders can easily identify trends, monitor performance metrics, and make informed decisions that enhance service quality and employee engagement. Continuous monitoring and analysis of these metrics will be vital for adapting to evolving business needs.
